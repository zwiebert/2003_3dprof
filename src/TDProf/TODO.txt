* BUGS

** bug-bw/12-Sep-05: copying.txt missing in NSIS distribution?

** bug-bw/29-Mar-04: Tray-Icon missing after return from Windows stand-by mode

** bug-bw/21-Nov-03: undoing checkboxing for "red-text" boxes does not
   happen for intial (at startup) loaded profile

** bug-bw/12-Oct-03: RegDiff: no output at Windows-98SE
*** debug-bw/17-Oct-03: Timer is not working. Dunno why. Maybe only
    one timer is allowed? Try to disable polling-timer which updates
    registry settings. (workaround: click into the window to trigger
    event)


* TODO

** todo-bw/12-Aug-04: Store locations of Walkthroughs, Hint sites,
   etc. Access them by a per profile list via button, menu, hotkey.

** todo-bw/24-Dec-03: Let the user choose a profile to start with
   Windows. (Maybe just add a -run "Some Profile" option to the 3DProf
   Registry value in Run key.)

** todo-bw/08-Dec-03: Show game icon somewhere in main window

** todo-bw/08-Dec-03: Impelement profile renaming by button or
   menu. (Problematic for Shell Shortcuts, so there woul be a reason
   for not having it. Cloning can be used for renaming too.)

** todo-bw/25-Nov-03: if no specfile is found, we should give the
   option to remove autostart

** todo-bw/15-Nov-03: Calc Checksum from important parsed data instead
   of file content.

** todo-bw/14-Nov-03: Let it run on unknonwn graphic boards. Just
   disable all graphic card dependent settings (D3D/OGL/...).

** ???-bw/14-Nov-03: What about F1 help for explaining some menu items
   to user? Or just displaying an info field somewhere and show help
   when mouse is over a menu.

** todo-bw/13-Nov-03: specfiles are using ISO-1 encoding only. I
   guess, Unicode woud be best for config-files.

** todo-bw/09-Nov-03: Copy settings dialog: Source and Destination
   profile are choosed via ComboBox. Special Source: "Current
   Settings", Special Destination: "All." Any option can be excluded
   from copy operation.

** todo-bw/12-Oct-03: Post-Commands: they should not require
   Auto-Restore to work

** todo-bw/01-Jul-03: Add Option to apply default profiles with
   special names before and after running a game. Useful, if a profile
   have some settings disabled.

** todo-bw/01-Jul-03: Implement Undo Current Settings Function by a
   list of AutoRestore() objects

** todo-bw/27-Jun-03: Add Undo profile to restore settings.

** todo-bw/22-Jun-03: New menu: Copy from...  current settings +
   profile (place on top the current settings and special profiles
   like Hight Quality)



* INCOMPLETE

*** done-bw/02-Oct-04: 1.3.82 - basic ATI CCC suporrt
** todo-bw/02-Oct-04: improve specfile::define_test macro
** todo-bw/02-Oct-04: clean up CCC section in ati-r300-win.cfg

** todo-bw/02-Aug-04: diagnostic logfile with filtering viewer
*** started-bw/02-Aug-04: todo: prevent logfile from fragmenting file system, implement viewer

** bug-bw/17-Jul-04: tray-menu/game.ini does not notice new entries
   unti program-restart.
*** workaround-bw/19-Jul-04: refreshed in a menu-popup callback

** todo-bw/18-Jul-04: NSIS installer
*** done-bw/18-Jul-04: first working version 

** todo-bw/05-Jul-04: Add and document internal :Resolution pre/post-command to change screen resolution
*** done-bw/05-Jul-04: Command added.
** todo-bw/05-Jul-04: document it:
:Resolution 1024x786@85
:Resolution 1024x786@85,32bpp
:Resolution 1024x786@85Hz,16bpp
:Resolution 2:1024x786@85 (display number currently does not work)


** todo-bw/28-Jun-03: The auto restore is not 100% reliable. It would
   be easy to just always open a popup windows to confirm restore. That
   would work with all games. Now we just open a requester then a game
   was running less than 2 minutes. That could mean, the game is using
   a launcher itself who detaches the game from the process started by
   us. NOLF and Morrowind and many other do this.
*** partially-done-bw/12-Nov-03: menu allows forcing the confirm
    requester dialog.


** bug-bw/28-Dec-03: When quitting TDProf.exe while it waits in Auto
   Restore thread the mutex survives. 3DProf cannot be started
   again. It should open a requester which offers full quit (incl. auto
   restore and cancel the quitting).
*** done-bw/18-Jun-04: Mutex.Close() is now explicitly called after
    the GUI is closed.

*** done-bw/02-Apr-04: manual images will be generated on user machine

*** done-bw/27-Mar-04: unmounting mounted images after game
**** left-bw/27-Mar-04: TDProfSL.exe support for that feature or
     removing TDProfSL.exe?. Making unmounting configurable?

*** done-bw/19-Feb-04: Updating private settings of ATI Control Panel.
**** left-bw/19-Feb-04: support for drivers older than 7.98
***** done-bw/26-Feb-04
**** left-bw/19-Feb-04: Win9x/ME support.

** todo-bw/27-Jan-04: Try to restore screen resolution after game
   finishes (in case there is something wrong with it). Do this
   restore together wit with ATI blackscreen.
*** done-bw/27-Jan-04: implemented in DisplayInfo class
    (save_resolution()/restore_resolution()). No ATI blackscreen
    optimization yet. Does not work with TDProfSL.exe.

** bug-bw/04-Jan-04: Problem with 2D profiles: They are bound to the video card at
   creation. Hotkeys stop to work as soon the card is changed. The
   user has to reattach the profile to the current board.
*** done-bw/04-Jan-04: user can choose 2D in menu Profile | Templates.
** todo-bw/04-Jan-04: Make templates accesible when creating new
   profiles.

** todo-bw/08-Dec-03: In-Game-HotKey function + Gamma settings
** todo-bw/24-Dec-01: Lauching profiles with hotkeys 
*** done-bw/24-Dec-03: Hotkey module implemented
*** done-bw/27-Dec-03: Profile hotkeys working

** todo: R6Probe-driver, R6Probe-lib, SetClk-lib: Move from assembly
   language to C.
*** done-bw/30-Nov-03: Both libs are now 100% C. I added NT-driver
    loading code in r6probe_open(). It should be at least useful for
    debugging r6probe.sys because latest driver binary is reloaded
    every time.

** bug-bw/22-Jun-03: Prevent open/save profiles by more than one
   instance of TDProf. Lock the file or prevent TDProf from running
   twice. -bw/25-Jun-03: But allow read-only access for -run option
   and maybe for GUI too (but options.cfg must be read-only too in
   this case).
*** done-bw/14-Dec-03: A Mutex is created when running with GUI. It
    contains a GUID. The GUID is stored in options.cfg config file as
    config_guid. This GUID is created once when config_guid does not
    exist. Using the absolute path for a Mutex name would not be
    possible (too long) and there may be different paths when using
    NTFS softlinks (junctions).
** todo-bw/14-Dec-03: Activate current running 3DProf instead of
   "Already Running" message box. 


* DONE

1.3.91

** bug-bw/16-Feb-05: GUI/exe-args: When inserting text into the

    -Zm. Fixed by using debug.exe option "-nmake NOMASMCOMPATIBILITY="

* 1.3.89

*** done-bw/08-Feb-05: SuspendLayout/ResumeLayout pair around
    update_from_gpd() for faster updating
*** done-bw/08-Feb-05: ComboBoxes on extra tabs (D3D, OGL) are now
    generated dynamically by code instead of GUI designer.
*** done-bw/08-Feb-05: MainForm::Tab::Experimental improved

** todo-bw/30-Oct-04: TDProfGD.exe - rename it to something else like
   <GameExeBaseName>.3DProf.exe or <ProfileName>.3DProf.exe to allow
   more than one copy in the same game directory
*** done-bw/31-Oct-04: <GameExeBaseName>.3DProf.exe is used (does not
    allow multiple profiles without renaming, but is easier to use in
    the Browser (just insert or remove "3DProf" before ".exe"


** bug-bw/03-Jun-04: src-distribution: specfiles not automatically copied
** bug-bw/03-Jun-04: src-distribution: nvclock.dll build before 2
   static libraries linked to it

    request.

** bug-bw/17-Aug-04: Unhandled Exception when clicking Save button,
   after deleting last profile (with highest index, and no following
   hidden profiles). (Also causes deleting unselected profiles, wehen
   hittin Delete butteon more than once)
*** done-bw/17-Aug-04: Delete-Button-click-handler now makes all
    current-profile (m_gpd, m_gpi) invalid.

*** done-bw/03-Aug-04: Experimental Clocking. On Radeon, W2K/XP only:
    Clocking DLL can now be enabled from Settings | Advanced |
    Alternative Clocking Implementation

*** done-bw/02-Aug-04: r6clock-lib and r6clock-dll: new divider
    calculation (old code had a problem with that common reference
    divider). Clocking on Radeon is now more accurate.

*** done-bw/18-Jul-04: R6ProbeInstaller: added InstallFolder dialog

** todo-bw/17-Jul-04: tray menu - game.ini: exception if game.ini doet
   not exist
*** done-bw/18-Jul-04: Exception catched by error
    messages. Notepad.exe used for unknown data-types.

** todo-bw/15-Jul-04: Add non-interactive self tests
*** done-bw/16-Jul-04: new option -selftest

** bug-bw/15-Jul-04: Exception in

*** done-bw/10-Jun-04/1.3.57: -alt_exe and -- option of TDProf.exe
    ingored. Missing code in new RunProile constructor.

*** done-bw/04-Jun-04: auto restore non-gui checkbox in settings
    dialog not set
*** done-bw/04-Jun-04: global disabling of autorestore was ignored in
    new unified run code

** bug-bw/01-Feb-04: 'Read' attribute in saving hotkeys

** bug-bw/22-Jan-04: Tray Icon: iconfy to tray while in timout for
   deferred icon hiding can cause both icon and window being
   invisible.
*** done-bw/22-Jan-04: code to abort thread added. Make sure all icon
    hiding is done through FormMain.tray_icon_visibility().

** bug-bw/21-Jan-04: Hotkey editor: Escape key did not work for
   application hotkeys.
*** done-bw/21-Jan-04: Copy&Paste error. It modified the profile
    hotkey Hashtable.

** bug-bw/21-Jan-04: Hotkey editor: modfier keys displayed after
   releasing them. (cosmetic error)
*** done-bw/21-Jan-04

** Clocking.cs: clocking is clamped to ac.clocking_limits now
*** done-bw/16-Jan-04

** todo-bw/04-Dec-03: Hidden names in specfiles. Can be used for
   configurations having more than one valid value (like unset
   registry values meaning the default). Can also be used for options
   not working, so we don't want to show them in combo box list, but
   telling the user the option if set by other tweakers.
*** done-bw/08-Dec-03: flags=(hidden) and parent="name". Needs to be
    documentet (done--bw/15-Jan-04)

** todo-bw/07-Dec-03: Add default clock configuration to
   Settings=>Clocking dialog.
*** done-bw/15-Jan-04: Clocking presets (Slow, Normal, Fast, Ultra)
   usable for clocking and restore.

** bug-bw/12-Jan-04: disabled clocks in profile not set to zero were
   applied
*** done-bw/12-Jan-04

*** done-bw/12-Jan-04: The 16bit shift to get the device ID to CPU
    register AX was done in each table lookup block again, instead
    once for all.


** bug-bw/07-Jan-04: 2D Profiles not always shown when "Hide Other Cards" is enabled.
*** done-bw/07-Jan-04: Compare method of GameProfileData now
    recognizes 2D profiles. Sorting will place them behind the
    profiles of the installed video board. (Maybe it would be better
    to place them before)

** new menu item Profile | Templates to set typical roles like 2D profile, Clocking-only
*** done-bw/04-Jan-04

** bug-bw/04-Jan-04: An undefined registry value (undef:dummy) is not
   recognized if its key does not exist. (Some sub-keys, like \OpenGL
   does not always exist from the beginning)

** bug-bw/28-Dec-03: Legacy code in FormMain is disabling menu items
   in Profile | Auto Restore
*** done-bw/28-Dec-03

** bug-bw/01-Dec-03: Belongs to this Card menu is using that old
   ax.spec_name. Problems with usr- prefixed files.
*** done-bw/01-Dec-03: ax.spec_name removed.

** Dist-Makefile has now greatly improved. Rules are build
   automatically from c++/c# project files by make_deps.sh
*** done-bw/01-Dec-03

** bug-bw/30-Nov-03: When apply a profile with disabled clockings,
    default clock is set.
*** done-bw/30-Nov-03

** todo: change auto-start option -iconic to "new" option -tray
** bug: windows-tweak menu is made by check_mv() because of copy&paste
    code-reuse.
** todo: specfile language: gui_label/gui_tooltip keywords can have
   two-letter-language suffixes.
** todo: config record: associative arrays (Hashtable class) are used
   to store localized text. Allows runtime switiching now.
*** done-bw/2x-Nov-03

*** done-bw/15-Nov-03: re-init 3D setting controls when users does
    language switching.

** todo: Separate item names from text shown in GUI controls (like
   always planned).
*** done-bw/13-Nov-03: New specfile item-tag "text" (optional
   text.TWO_LETTER_LANG_CODE).
*** left-todo: Fix all code which reads-back control text instead of
   item name (new checkboxing feature does this x-/ ).
*** done-bw/15-Nov-03

** todo-bw/15-Nov-03: Allow modifications of specfile config records.
*** done-bw/15-Nov-03: new label prefix [+] to extend data
    (e.g. adding localized texts)

*** done-bw/15-Nov-03: in ConfigRecord.cs: ConfigItem and ConfigItems
    are now private nested classes.

** todo-bw/12-Nov-03: Problem wiith check boxes in 3D settings:
   ComboBox does have that special Text-Red state. This happens if a
   value is not really part of the list. So it is shown red in the
   combo box as text, so the user should choose a existing value from
   list. How to do this with check boxes? maybe by using the text
   part? Or just making the combo box visible again?
*** done-bw/14-Nov-03: combo boxes turn back visible as long there is
    no value from list selected.

** bug-bw/14-Nov-03: Mouse-over feedback: does not work for row-label
   on (double-width) Radeon-SmartShader checkboxes
*** done-bw/14-Nov-03: Old number of 2*2 extra options was used. I
    knew it was a mistake to use literals. Now using new constants
    cr_modes_extra[12]_start.

** bug-bw/13-Nov-03: Error in rv-strict regexp. Bitmasks of both dword
   and hex wasn't followed by an ? to make them optional. So the old
   rv regexp was used.
*** done-bw/13-Nov-03

** remade profile options about autore_restore.
*** done-bw/13-Nov-03: no backward compatibility (maybe I add code for
    that tomorrow)

** bug-bw/12-Nov-03: in profile summary, RAM to free and process prio
   class only displayed if game ini file present.
*** done-bw/12-Nov-03: wrong if-block nesting

** "use 3d checkboxes" now configurable by user
** added special 2 ATI menus to open control panel in new and old
   version
*** done-bw/12-Nov-03

** bug-bw/12-Nov-03: menu Experimenal Menu Icons is not saving the
   settings. And it is not initialized from settings at loading.
*** done-bw/12-Nov-03

** bug-bw/11-Nov-03: -alt_exe was not working with TDProfSL.exe. Plus,
   it required at least a dummy exe in profile.
*** done-bw/11-Nov-03

** In FormMain.cs: running a game (incl. all pre-commands) is now done
   in its own thread. (GUI stays responsible; waiting-only thread no
   longer needed)
*** done-bw/10-Nov-03

** bug-bw/30-Oct-03: Vanishing image file menu items in tray menu when
   updating image files in main window.
*** done-bw/10-Nov-03: In init_tray_menu_from_gp(): menu was not a member of parent-menu array.

** bug-bw/08-Nov-03: Wrong registry path in R6Probe MSI installer (one
   should not do any coding while being half asleep)
*** done-bw/08-Nov-03

** bug-bw/20-Oct-03: If included spec-file missing then error message
   reports the wrong (topmost) missing file.
** include config file name and line number in specfile-parse-error messages
*** done-bw/30-Oct-03

** RegDiff: menu-item for regdiff of ATI software key
** RegDiff: header containing key-name and logfile-name
** New feature: Pre/Post commands
** GUI improvements
** Localization
** Specfile-Syntax: if(lang == Two_Letter_ISO) added
** Specfile-Content: Detonator-51.xx support.
** Specfile-Content: Catalyst-3.8 SmartShader support.
** Bug: DisplayInfo.cs: Missing [Out] in DevMode struct
** Distributions-Makefile: Source files are now extracted from VS7 project files.
** bug-bw/07-Jul-03: check for number format of timer update interval setting
*** done-bw/Sep..Oct-03

** todo-bw/29-Jul-03: A registry history window which shows changes to
   values in driver key by other programs.
*** done-bw/06-Aug-03

** bug-bw/08-Jul-03: Make GUI-Autorestore Thread safe
*** done-bw/06-Aug-03: An invisible TextBox is used for thread communication (XXX)
**** done-bw/10-Nov-03: Corrected: Invoke() method is now used.

** todo-bw/25-Jul-03: include command for specfiles
*** done-bw/27-Jul-03: implemented include, if, elif, else, endif commands.

** todo-2003-06-18: "find target" button like in Explorer short cuts
   properties to explore folder containing exe
*** done-bw/07-Jul-03

** todo-bw/22-Jun-03: allow multiple sets of 3D Settings in profiles,
   automatically choosed by current video card. but we want to keep it
   simple.
*** done-bw/??-Jul-03

** todo-bw/23-Jun-03: To process Shell Links we could have a lean
   C/C++ executable. At least we could make a C# program w/o uneeded
   functionality (libraries, saving profiles, storing all profiles).
   That program could be check for non-gui options and start the
   actual GUI enabled program if needed.
*** done-bw/???

** todo--bw/27-Jun-03: Do optional waiting for a started game to exit
   and restore settings to old values.
*** done-bw/???

** todo-bw/06-Jul-03: Add regval "undefined" for ConfigItem/specfile, to
   represent a nonexisting value.
*** done-bw/07-Jul-03

** todo-bw/07-Jul-03: Grouping ComboxBoxes on Extra + Extra2 by 3D-Api
   could be better, because a lot of options does not exist on both
   APIs. Currently its grouped by DriverSettings-Group and
   ProfileSettings-Group
*** done-bw/07-Jul-03

** bug-bw/07-Jul-03: Adding user defined names breaks support for
   multiple video cards of course. To fix this, it should just save
   unknown text between known options along with each option. This way
   we can preserve user comments too.
*** done-bw/07-Jul-03: Fix was easy. GammeProfileData.add() just saves
    options not found in names array to unknown_options as
    preformatted text ready to print.

*** done-bw/06-Jul-03: AppConfig has not accepted empty option values
    due to a broken regexp.

*** done-bw/28-Jun-03: Changed enable/disable profiles combo boxes
    from toggle to left/right click enable/disable. combinine
    row/column toggles is unusable. Disabling is now fully implemented.

*** done-bw/27-Jun-03: Bug: Using a shell link for a nonexistent
    profile results in crashing. Now an error message is shown and
    program quits.

** todo-2003-06-13: if a profile value is unknown just show it as
    coloured text in combo box (if possible with a dropdown list)
*** done-bw/26-Jun-03: note: I had to change DropDownStyle for such
    ComboBoxes while such a text ist showed.

** todo-bw/26-Jun-03: Edit Button for Game .ini/.cfg Files which
   remembers the file path per Profile.
*** done--bw/26-Jun-03: note: currently no button, but a menu item.

** todo-bw/25-Jun-03: How to set visible part of text in TextBox? If
   the text does not fit in the box I would prefer to schow the end of
   text not the start.
*** done-bw/26-Jun-03: This seems to work: void f(TextBox textBox) {
    textBox.SelectionStart = textBox.Text.Length; }

** todo-2003-06-20: add commandline argument to start a profile
   directly (e.g. tdprof -run "GTA III")
*** done-bw/21-Jun-03

** todo-2003-06-13: Are there associative arrays in C#/.NET?
*** done: class Hashtable

** todo-2003-06-15: Allow alternative syntax from windows .reg files
   like "hex:00,00,00,00" instead type="REG_BINARY" value="00000000"
*** done


* CANCELLED

** todo-bw/27-Jun-03: Allow creating hard-links associated with Shell
   Shortcuts. Currently a shortcut is a soft-link to a game
   profile. If the profile will be altered or deleted the shortcut is
   affected. This is not always the expected behavior. In Radlinker
   everey Link has its own configuration. Both kind of links are
   useful.
*** cancelled-bw/18-Jun-04: The small benefit would not justify
    complicating the code
