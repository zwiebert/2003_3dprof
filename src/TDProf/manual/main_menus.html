<h3>Game Folder</h3>
<h3>Image Mounting</h3>
<h3>Process Priority</h3>
<h3>Freeing RAM</h3>

<p>That "RAM to free" option is supposed to make more physical RAM available before the game starts. This may speed up game start, if page file is located on the same disk as the game or something. Or one could prefer to wait before the game starts (you could go to the bathroom or something) instead of having to wait the same time in the game for loading a game level.

<p>The option just calls a programm free_ram.exe, which is very basic at the moment. You could look at free_ram.c to see the source code.

<h3>Auto Restore</h3>

<h3>Guess 3D API Now</h3>

<p>This scans some of the files in the game folder to find out if D3D
or OGL or both are used by this game. To show the result, it just
disables all unused APIs in GUI. It guesses wrong often. It's not
possible to make that option 100% reliable.
