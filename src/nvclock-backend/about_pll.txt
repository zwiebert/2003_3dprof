Some Info About PLL (-bw/28-Nov-03)

From an ST doc:
The three dividers used within the PLL are referred to as M
(predivider), N (feedback divider) and P (postdivider) for
brevity.


bw:
Schematic:
 baseclock - XTAL controlled constant clock
 voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) - genereates variable clockrate
 phase difference detector (PFD): phase comparator which generates controlling voltage for VCO
 predivider (M): between baseclock and phase comparator input 1
 feedback divider (N): between VCO and phase comparator input 2
 postdivider (P): between VCO output and out-clock (?)


 Note that there is a divide-by-2 fixed prescaler before the
feedback divider.

The binary values applied to the programmable dividers, and the
frequency of CLOCKIN controls the output frequency of the PLL
macrocell:

where the values of M, N and P must satisfy the following constraints:
