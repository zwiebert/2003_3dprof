<H3>Using WinIo from a non-administrative account</H3>

<P>
WinIo can now be used from non-administrative accounts under Windows NT/2000/XP.
In order to support this configuration, the WinIo driver (winio.sys) must be first
installed on the system from an administrative account using the <B><A HREF="InstallWinIoDriver.htm">InstallWinIoDriver</A></B>
function, which is provided by the library. Following installation, the driver will
load automatically whenever Windows starts. An application will then be able to use
the library's functions to access I/O ports and physical memory.
</P>

<P>
You should take the following steps in order to use WinIo from a non-administrative account:
<OL>
<LI>Place winio.dll, winio.vxd and winio.sys in the directory where your application resides.
<LI>Log on as an administrator.
<LI>Call <B><A HREF="InstallWinIoDriver.htm">InstallWinIoDriver</A></B> with the first parameter set to the path of the winio.sys file (e.g. c:\myapp\winio.sys).
<LI>Reboot the system.
<LI>Log on as a regular user.
<LI>You should now be able to use WinIo in the same way as when using the library
   from an administrative account.
<LI>When WinIo is no longer required, call <B><A HREF="RemoveWinIoDriver.htm">RemoveWinIoDriver</A></B>
to remove the WinIo driver from the system. This must be performed from an administrative account.
</OL>
