You're correct. Public version of r6probe and all custom drivers based
upon its' source code totally ignore PLL pos dividers.  Correct clock
calculation formula for PLL used on RADEON boards is:

clk = 2 * feedback_divider * reference_clk / ( reference_divider * post_divider)

whilst r6probe and its' clones use:

clk = feedback_divider * reference_clk / (reference_divider)

The second formula gives correct result in one and the only case -
when post divider is set to 2 by default. Happily the most of
reference ATI BIOS'es generate post_divider = 2 for default clock
frequencies, so r6probe's clock calculation formula works
too. However, latest R360/RV360 boards (especially ASUS) tend to set
post_divider to different value so the formula simply doesn’t work.
